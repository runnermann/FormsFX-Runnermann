@todo: 2017-6-26 FlashMonkeyV02-2017-06-26: 

Problem: Logic Question.
     * ??!!! Should current card be in FlashCard??? or in ReadFlash?
     * Problem,,,, when switching between decks, Current card must be reset, 
     *       if current card resides in FlashCard, then it belongs to that 
     *       object. If currentCard is in FlashCard then it does not need 
     *       to be reset when switching between decks. And while implementing.
     * Solved... Current card is moved to ReadFlash. 
     * Proposed ... In the next re-design
     * Q&A and Test modes will reside in their own classes and each will 
     * contain their own currentCard and their own flashList. 

1) -Done- Finish Search by adding getQ button on list of questions. IOW in other words
a way for the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson to see (via a button) one of the items that have been
returned from the search. 
 - Also create a drop up panel that flys up showing the list of questions available
for the search that has been returned.
2) -Done- Add or fix edit in Q&A mode
3) -Resolved- Fix search in test mode
    ? Should there be a search while in the test mode? No there are hints already
!3) Graphic pull bar for edit
4) -Done- last q and first q from list buttons
5) Spell help that comes from the AVL tree or Map
!6) Memory: making use of the remember and forget ... or hide and show values. 
These require a link to the next remember value. I.e. if 5 is shown but 6 through 
100 are hidden, then looping through each flashcard to check to see if its remember
value is not hidden would be O(n). However if a double linked-list type of 
structure with prev and next variables pointing to the next remembered variable 
would make finding the next visible flashcard O(1).
7) -Done- Add capabilities from next button to previous button. 
8) Delete or hide files from listOfFiles
9) Update constructors in FlashCard for the added variables rtDate, 

@todo DEBUG
1) Problem: (Non-issue) When changing from edit mode back to test mode, the select button
is missing. This is because the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson should not have the option to edit a
question and then answer it. This would allow a form of cheating. Even though
it's a self driven test.  
2) Problem: (Fixed) The visible index becomes out of sync and causes an overrun or null pointer
problem. The back button, is not set to inop. This should be taken care of by 
placing the current card in the FlashCard class. Since the problem seems to occur
when switching between decks.  -Fixed ls
!3) Problem: When deleting cards from the deck. If the last card is deleted the GUI locks
in place. Reason has not been found.  
4) Problem: (Fixed) Remove ScrollPane from the create new stack scene. 
5) Problem: (Fixed) Edit spacing on newFileScene page.
6) Problem: (Fixed) Text in create flash card pane in answer pane does not delete on click 
on initial screen. 
7) Problem: "ClickMe button" not updating after 4 cards are created. 
8) Problem: Crash when attempting to go into test & Q&A mode and there are no cards in 
the flashList.  
 

// *** MODIFICATION LOG ***
2017-9-1 Moved showAnsAndScoreButtons from EditFlashPane class to ReadFlash.
More appropriate use and logical layout of the classes.
class. -LS
2017-9-2 Renamed ReadFlash.lastQButton to ReadFlash.prevQButton. For clarity. 
Last should be end of the array. -LS.

2017-9-11 added gauges and Medusa Gauge library. The medusa library is huge and 
the gauges add alot of weight/memory usage to the program. Seems unneccessary
but the medusa gauage library allows alot of flexibility by its design. Unfortunatly
it adds too much weight and will need to create specific gauges for the program.

2017-9-12 Modifications nearly complete. This copy is published as last copy before 
adding Gradle.

2017-9-12 Added ScrollPane to listOfFiles in the first shown scene.
2017-9-18 Removed scrollPane from newFileScene by adding if statements in FlashMonkeyMain(). 
2017-9-18 Added Last index and First index to the menu buttons. 
2017-9-18 Reshaped the qButtons to round buttons
2017-9-19 Removed ScrollPane from newFileScene
2017-9-19 Created getFirstScene() method that retrieves the first scene. 
2017-9-19 Created better layout for newFilePane.
2017-9-19 Fixed bug in create file AnswerPane prompt text. Set another element
focused so that prompt text would show. Removed extra methods for prompt text 
to work while in focus that didn't work. 
2013-9-24 Changed remember in editFlashPane from switch function to display 
the remember buttons to if statements. This allows remember to be greater 
than 0 forget less than 0 and normal == 0.  

2017-10-24 Major modifications to enable tree rotation and single node navigation. 
Added treewalker class which inherits AVLTree. Current tree next and prev
buttons work. 1st and last buttons do not work. There is no way to get the
tree root. It moves when the tree rotates. Although when a node is added and the 
tree rotates while add is active, once adding is complete, it apears that 
the root is lost. Added a treeRoot, farLeft, and farRight to the base tree class. 
This might not be an appropriate location for these new values. Look into this
there might be a better way to track these points. 
    - @todo for treewalker class. 
        1) need to track treeRoot, far left, and far right treePoints. This 
        enables an O(1) access to these points on the tree. 
        2) need to convert the current tree to a double threaded tree. The 
        current modification, a threeWayTree, AVLTree with a parent in each node
    
2017-11-10 Near completion of single node navigation and Q wrong-add feature. 
Tree rotation is working, navigation from node to node is working, 
    Problem with size of tree or the number of nodes in the tree. This impacts 
    the numbering of nodes when the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson walks through the tree. It also impacts
    any methods that are based on the numbering. 

2017-11-23 Bug correction. Error with correct answer. Does not appear to be 
updating. Occasionally, the correct answer is not the correct answer, and 
a wrong answer is correct. -Solved... problem was with the ...object. This was 
a difficult problem to track down. 

2017-11-27 Working on Test selectAnswerButton colors in ReadFlash. Created method 
ansQButtonSetting() to disable and set the color of the button while navigating 
through the tree. The button should be disabled if a questions answer has been 
viewed in Q&A mode or if it has been answered previously. The method needs to be 
implemented in lastQButton and firstQButton modes. Need to look at integrating 
button actions and colors into a single class. IE into the MVC architechture.  

@todo 2017-12-1 set buildFileName() to alpha only. Currently set to read in and filter manually
however, this could allow anything that is not in the list. 

@todo 2017-12-1 set compareTo in readFlash to aNumber instead of qNumber. qNumber 
causes a continious loop error. 

@todo 2017-12-1 when should refresh flashList be done now that q&a and test are 
using the tree?
    1) After editing?
    2) After adding new cards
    3) refreshFlashList should include adding new nodes to the tree? or make 
        sure to add the edited nodes and added nodes to the tree. 

@todo 2017-12-1 Is the flashCard score variable needed for each flashCard? 
    Yes, keep it, it may provide a fuzzy priority that the other variables do not. 

@todo 2017-12-5 Problem, seeing cards that were seen the last review session and
not seeing cards that are further back in the stack. Need to use dateRt to assist
with reorganizeing the deck so that the cards at the back of the deck are seen
more frequently. Or.. maybe this is already done with score and remember. No. it 
is not. Corrected: LS 2017-12-12

@todo 2017-12-12 All known & requested capabilities with exception to
a selectable forget button in the card have been implemented. All visible & 
known bugs have been corrected, with exception to re-prioritization of cards
that have not been seen. There remains a bug in the numbering
system. It exists after the buildTree method has added it to the tree. 
FMTree does not appear to add any numbers to the a cards qNumber. Still searching
for this error. When cards are added to the tree. The correct qNumber appears 
to be added correctly. When viewing a cards qNumber in the flashCard it apears
to have been multiplied by another factor of 10 and 1 added to it. ?????!!!!!

see card number 77 below being added in buildTree and FMTree. "I don't see the issue
anymore" 2017-12-20 
  
    adding 77 to tree,
    parent is 73
    adding card in build tree
    getRemember = 0
    localCard.getRtDate().getDayOfYear();343
    localCard aNum date is less than lastDate2017-12-09T07:52:00.577-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]
    QNumber set to 780
    localCard qNum = 780

    and the results displayed at the card in the gui
    adding 77 to tree,
    parent is 73
    adding card in build tree
    getRemember = 0
    localCard.getRtDate().getDayOfYear();343
    localCard aNum date is less than lastDate2017-12-09T07:52:00.577-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]
    QNumber set to 780
    localCard qNum = 780

@todo Bug on edit. When the card is updated in the backUpList it is using
the QNumber, QNumber is the number given to the card to set it's location
in the tree, or precedence. aNumber, "not an appropriate name" is the 
number that is given at the index.  

@todo edit regex match on line809 FlashCard so that it restricts file to 
letters and digits only. 

@todo bug issue... FM is online & stores files on online server. However, currently 
attempting to implement uploading and downloading the file only once, download at
the beginning, and upload on closing. A bug is created and cuauses the program to hang
when attempting to get a file that has just been created. Multiple linkObj class objects
are created. for some reason. even though there is only one instatiation at the beginning
of the FlashCard class. This suggests that the FlashCard class is created mutiple times
unneccessarily as well. However, this creates an issue, since the file is passed using
the LinkObj class object. The file is contained in the linkObj. The default constuctor
causes the linkObj to have a new adress and thus... loosing the file link. Last was looking for
the locations that are creating new LinkObjs or calling FlashCard unneccissarily. uGGGG!!!
(FlashMonkey is online!!!)

@todo 2017/02/25 11:06am Working on JUnit Testing in Test folder TestClassTest.java.
Just moved the extend from Test class to FlashMonkey class. Move was successful,
however the problems continue. Although treeNodeHasData() is successful,
firstNodeHasData() causes an error. Meaning that it doesn't fail nor succeed, 
it causes a runtime error. 
-The purpose of building the JUnit test is an issue with incorrect answers in the 
Test.theseAns array. The array should contain 1 correct answer and three from other
answers. At times, answers are repeated within the array, and at times, there
is no correct answer. This is an inconsistent error and JUnit will assist
with automated testing of FlashCard, and Test classes. Goal is to build out testing
to test the entire class in a monte-carlo type of test.  ** DONE -LS **

@todo 2018/04/21 Problem with ansAry in Test(): Find repeated answers in ansAry.
Possible problems:
    1. Problem with instantiation of new Test() or new Test( ... )
    2. Problem with creation of testAry
        a. Test in test class to attempt to repeat the problem =
        ( TestClassTest.find fails ) There is no JavaFX implementation being run
        in TestClassTest. It is likely either instantiation, or the creation of the testAry
    - Multiple problems here. Primarily, a loop error where the for loop would not start at 0 when the index was
    set to 0 in the block. The for loop incremented to the next index thus changing the loop to 0 would result
    in an increment to 1. Thus the 0 index was skipped. The method would not detect the number in the first element
    of the array and thus it would frequently be repeated. This was fixed by setting the centurion value to -1 in the block
    - Other errors with incorrect variable assigned to the index. This is a non-traditional method to avoid repeating
    values in the array. *** DONE *** Massive problem and hard to debug. Solution was: in some parts of the array, set
    the index to -1 instead of zero because the index is incremented so that the lowest index, 0, is skipped before
    it is added to the array.
    -This method, due to the use of random if a number has been repeated, is extreemly slow.
    -Must be a better way.

@todo 2018/05/13 Problem with answerSet that is modifiable by the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson in the editPane. ansSet was not being added
to the flashCard object due to a problem in the copy constructor. As well as the set remember using the rdo buttons.
These have been solved. ** DONE **

@todo 2018/05/13 Problem with flashList. As cards are being added into the stack when the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson get's the question wrong,
these appear to be being added into the file so that. There are several copies of the question when the file has
just been built.
@todo 2018/05/13 Need to determin how to descriminate or allow repeated answers that are in the ansSet. IE, if an answer is no or
false. And if that answer is randomly inserted into answers, then no would be a correct answer in only one of the
answers when it would be two. Should this answer not be allowed to be inserted into the list of answers? (Descriminate)
or should it be allowed and the correct letter be added. Seems to be poor form if the word "no" is repeated, or any other
word is repeated. This is actually poor test writing, however flashcard creators are not professionals. The objective
of the ansSet is to allow the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson to tell FlashMonkey that this questions answer, has other answers that would be
correct as well. IE if two questions were very similar.
 -One potential solution is to store answers in a hash and do something if there is a match. IE automatically add it
 into ansSet. This is not a total solution, since a close match would not be detectable.

 @todo 2018/06/21 UI UPGRADE! Show the create tree in the treeWindow. As the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson creates a card, show the new card
 being inserted and it's naturally ordered location in the tree. Also, allow the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson to move/re-order thier cards

 @todo 2018/06/21 II UPGRADE! Allow the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson to edit cards from the create window or treeWindow

 @todo 2018/06/24 UI UPGRADE! Co-locate buttons and move selectAnswer button out of the way

 @todo 2018/06/24 UI UPGRADE! Give the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson a checkbox to hide question, or to be moved to the front of the stack. IE higher
 priority.

 @todo 2018/06/24 PERFORMANCE consideration ! Use bit mask to check for odd numbers instead of (N % 2 == 0)

 LEARNNG AND ORGANIZATION, Concept change.
 PROBLEM: Information overload, caused by a lack of an apparent direction. I.E. Learning addition, subtraction, multiplication
 and division without any practical understanding of why.... Why do I need to subtract and divide, why do I need to
 multiply. Perhaps a poor example, but... understand how what is being taught is applied to te overall picture helps to
 understand the problem being solved.

 Information is simply useless without a practical understanding of why, or a theory of the why. This may stem from th
 loss of connection in teaching. IE "Class, today we are going to learn to add." Student "Why do I need to know how to
 add." I have a calculator to do that. Teacher "So you can be smart." Student "I can be smart by knowing how the universe
 was created. I can be smart by... blah blah blah..." The point being, that without purpose, the information is lost.

 SOLUTION: Organization by task and accomplishment. A tree starting with the product that you are working towards. And
 groups of tasks that it takes to get there. Thus, like lego blocks, it is easier to organize the information as a student
 if the goal is understood in the beginning. Studying becomes clear, and teaching becomes clear.

Teacher Edition:
Teacher writes the question. Student writes the answer and submits.

@todo 2018/07/10 BUG in EditFlashPane: Save card does not save when the authcrypt.user.EncryptedPerson navigates left or right and edits more than on card.

Notes for FlashCardMM
        PROBLEM:    now that Files are associated with card numbers, and card Numbers should never change? there is a problem with
        deleting or reorganizing a deck. IE if a card is added to the center of the deck, the deck order changes, the
        index number has changed and thus, the cardNumber is no longer the index of the question or answer. This is a
        challenge since the card ID comes from the index when the card is originally created. When cards are inserted
        and deleted from the center of the deck. The order and index has changed. Files are no longer correctly associated
        with the index. And otherAnswers are no longer correct.

        SOLUTION:   A possible solution is that a cardID never changes, and is used for files and for associating
        correctAnswers, and otherAnswerArray. A cards index when it is uploaded from
        a file into the system becomes the cards ANumber, and the QNumber, as is currently , is used to prioritize the card
        when it is inserted into the tree.

        The aNumber is replacing the previous Answer.qNum.
        The FlashCardMM.cardNum or cNum is a non-changable number in a hashmap or array. TBD


BUG REPORT 2019/01/21 Bug in FlashCard MM-MT
        @todo BUG fix image referance for question and answer. LS
        Problem:   When a flashcard contains images in both the question and the answer sections, when the Question image
        is clicked on , the answer image is displayed. Ooooooops!!!! lol.
