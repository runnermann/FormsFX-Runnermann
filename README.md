Before contributing or modifying another author's code, please inform them that you are modifying or modified their code. 

<b>Bug Status</b>: Issue #1 when 1st setting up the IDE and trying to Run FlashMonkey. There was an image missing from src/image/ ... . The image is in the correct location in the repository. 

<b>Fix</b>: 2 ways. If you haven't made changes to your branch yet, Branch from the latest version of the main branch, and in your IDE pull from your branch. Or download the file directly to your src/image directory. The name of the image is <i>flash_astronaut_grey_150.png</i>. Note the image is in <i>src/image/emojis/ ...</i>



**JavaDocs** To generate JavaDocs using IntelliJ. Goto Tools -> Generate JavaDoc. Recommend generating javadocs to a file outside of the project. Else IntelliJ may intelligently decide to stick JavaDocs where it is most convienient. Select Private and press "ok". A browser page should be displayed that shows the documents. 


**To get started and IDE setup**
_If you have Gradle installed:_ This is a Gradle project. The build.gradle file is under flashmonkey.multimedia.

_Download the video "GetStarted.mp4" to see where the flashMonkeyFile directory files are. This is where flashcard decks are stored. You may need to pause the video to see it. Download the flashMonkeyFile located above, and place it your IdeaProjects folder. The file contains a card deck which "may?" be the issue with attempting to get FlashMonkey running the first time._
